I am founding director of the [Center for Geospatial Sciences](http://spatial.ucr.edu) and [Professor of Public Policy](http://facultyprofiles.ucr.edu/spp_dept/faculty/Sergio_Rey/index.html) at the University of California, Riverside.


My research interests are in geographic information science, spatial inequality dynamics, regional science, spatial econometrics, and spatial data science.

This research  significantly benefits from, and contributes to, open source software and the practice of open science.

You can hit the links above to learn more about these things, or check out my ramblings on [the blog](/).
